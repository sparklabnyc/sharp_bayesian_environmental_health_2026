# SHARP: Bayesian Modeling for Environmental Health Workshop

![](assets/bmeh-1200x630.jpg)

## Introduction

GitHub repo through which we're developing and sharing materials for the SHARP Bayesian Modeling for Environmental Health Workshop, taking place in person during August 5th-7th 2026.

## Notes for attendees

The workshop will be a series of lectures and interactive supervised lab sessions. We hope it's informative and fun!

We will be using `Posit (RStudio) Cloud`, which assumes knowledge of `R` and `RStudio`. We will also ask you to pull the final versions of the `GitHub` repo to your Cloud account. The basics of doing this are in a previously-created guide found via [another guide repo](https://github.com/rmp15/rstudio_cloud_tutorial/tree/main).

This workshop is written partly in [`NIMBLE`](https://r-nimble.org/). There are also several elements later on in [`R-INLA`](https://www.r-inla.org/).

Below is the set of labs to follow throughout the two days:

## Notes for those working on the repo

### Using `pre-commit`

Run `pre-commit install` to install the hooks. You now won't be able to commit until you pass the hooks. These (among other things) automatically format files and prevent us from committing ugly code. For more details, see the main [docs](https://pre-commit.com/) and the `R` [docs](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/precommit/).

### Using `renv`

`renv` maintains consistency between users' `R` environments. Run `renv::restore()` and the environment will be downloaded into the repository based on the `renv.lock` file. If you want to add a packages to the lockfile, install the package and then run `renv::snapshot()`. For more details, see the [docs](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).

### Using `Quarto` for presentations

Quarto is pretty cool. I won't bore you, but have a look at the [docs](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/). Here, we're using it for [presentations](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/). It's designed by the folks at `RStudio`, so you `R` folk will be happy. Make a `.qmd` file and run `quarto render *.qmd` to generate the `html`, which you can open in browser. We can get fancy and import our own `css` to have a consistent theme for out presentations.
